# berlin-street-generator

A fun project I created during Covid-19 Lockdown to find inspiration for city walks in Berlin.

Online at https://berlin-spaziert.netlify.app/

Due to popular request, I also created a version for the city of Freiburg, which lives in the `freiburg` branch.
You can find it at https://freiburg-spaziert.netlify.app/ 

Happy walking ðŸ™‚
